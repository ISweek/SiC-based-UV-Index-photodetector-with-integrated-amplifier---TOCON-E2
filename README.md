  <strong>What is a TOCON?</strong><br />
            A TOCON is a 5 Volt powered UV   photodetector with integrated amplifier converting UV radiation into a 0   … 5V volt-age output. The V out pin of the TOCON can be directly   connected to a controller, a voltmeter or any other data analyz-ing   device with voltage input.<br />

  <strong>Information about the UV-Index (UVI) </strong><br />
            The UV-Index is an international standard   measurement of how strong the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is   at a particular place on a particular day. It is a scale primarily used   in daily forecasts aimed at the general public. The UV-Index is   calculated by integrating the sun’s UV spectrum multiplied with the   Erythema action curve (see spectral responsivity). That integral is   divided by 25 mW/m 2 to generate a convenient index value, which becomes   essentially a scale of 0 to 10. The Erythema action curve is a   wavelength resolved measure of the sunburn danger. It is maxi-mised at   297nm (UVB) and then strongly decreases towards UVA radiation.nput.<br />
